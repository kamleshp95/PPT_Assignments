    "#### **Question 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Given an array, for each element find the value of the nearest element to the right which is having a frequency greater than that of the current element. If there does not exist an answer for a position, then make the value ‘-1’.\n",

    "Given array a[] = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]\n",

    "   As it has frequency of 3 and no other next element\n",
    "   has frequency more than 3 so  '-1'\n",
    "2. For element a[1] = 1 it will be -1 same logic\n",
    "   like a[0]\n",
    "3. For element a[2] = 2 which has frequency = 2,\n",

    "5. For element a[4] = 4 which has frequency = 1,\n",
    "   NGF element is 2 at position = 5 with frequency\n",
    "   of 2 > 1\n",
    "6. For element a[5] = 2 which has frequency = 2,\n",
    "   NGF element is 1 at position = 6 with frequency\n",
    "   of 3 > 2\n",
